		        		<h2>Project Description:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> <p>The purpose of this project was to establish a collection of datasets that could be used (1) to analyze the influence of partnership networks on the transmission of sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections, and (2) to examine the influence of study design on estimation of network properties and impacts. Eight studies contributed datasets to the collection.</p>
<p>They include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Colorado Springs Project 90, 1988-1992</li>
<li>Bushwick [Brooklyn, NY] Social Factors and HIV Risk (SFHR) Study, 1991-1993</li>
<li>Atlanta Urban Networks Project, 1996-1999</li>
<li>Flagstaff Rural Network Study, 1996-1998</li>
<li>Atlanta Antiretroviral Adherence Study, 1998-2001</li>
<li>Houston Risk Networks Study, 1997-1998</li>
<li>Baltimore SHIELD (Self-Help in Eliminating Life-Threatening Diseases), 1997-1999</li>
<li>Manitoba Chlamydia Study, 1997-1998</li></ol>
<p>Each study contains information on sexual, needle sharing, and/or social networks. Each dataset was harmonized to permit comparative analysis. Almost all of the studies were research projects funded by federal agency sources (e.g., United States Centers for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health); one was funded by Canadian sources. These studies, all closed for further enrollment, provide a range of designs and study types as well as a range of transmitted diseases. This allows researchers to investigate the relative effect of personal behavior and network connections on the dynamics of disease transmission, and to explore the impact of sampling design on estimation of network properties. Respondents were asked questions about different test results such as HIV, chlamydia, syphilis and hepatitis. Demographic variables include race, ethnicity, marital status, age, and gender.</p></span></p>

								<p><span><strong>Data Collection Notes:</strong> The original principal investigators of the studies that contributed data, who also served as consultants to the project, include: David C. Bell (Affiliated Systems Corporation, Houston, TX), Samuel R. Friedman (National Development and Research Institutes, Inc., New York City, NY), Carl Latkin (Lighthouse Studies at Peer Point, John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD), John J.

Muth (Quintus-ential Solutions, Colorado Springs, CO) performed the data harmonization., The data files can be linked through the following relationships: link to Persons dataset via variables STUDYNUM and RID; link to Egodyads dataset via variables STUDYNUM, RID, and ITER; link to Altdyads dataset via variables STUDYNUM, RID, and ITER.</span></p>
		        		<h2>Methodology:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Sample:</strong> <ol>
<li><p>Colorado Springs Project 90 (Colorado Springs, Heterosexual high-risk networks), 1988-1992.</p>
<p>N = 595 respondent individuals</p>
<p>Age = 15 and older</p>
<p>Sampling strategy: (a) Targeted outreach provided seeds for prostitutes, and  IDU's and their sex partners, and social contacts. (b)
modified chain-link strategy for recruited cross-links.</p></li>
<li><p>Manitoba Chlamydia Study (Manitoba chlamydia network) provisional version, November  1997-May 1998.</p>
<p>N = 2,120 respondents/cases (current version does not allow distinction) </p>
